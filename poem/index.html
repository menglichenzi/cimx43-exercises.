       <ul>How did you find the enery. Mom</ul>
       <ul>To do all the things you did.</ul>
       <ul>To be teacher, nurse and counselor</ul>
       <ul>To me, when i was a kid.</ul>
       <ul>How did you do it all. Mom</ul>
       <ul>Be a chauffeur, cook and friend.</ul>
       <ul>Yet find time to be a playmate.</ul>
       <ul>I just cannot comprehend.</ul>
       <ul>I see now it was love, Mom</ul>
       <ul>That made you come whenever i'd call,</ul>
       <ul>Your inexhaustible love, Mom</ul>
       <ul>And I thank you for it all.</ul>
